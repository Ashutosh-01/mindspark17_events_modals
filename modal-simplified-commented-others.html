			<h2>Objectives :</h2>
			<p>
			Search N Destroy is basically a line following and maze solving competition.
			A track of white line on black background and/or black line on white background will be 
			laid out <b>with codes placed at some places</b> and an <b>autonomous robot</b> has to follow that line, 
			decode the path <b>based upon that code</b> and complete a task.<br>
<!--<ol>
<li>
To test the metallographic skills of students for sample preparation.
</li><li>
To test the logical reasoning ability o
f students by observation of 
microstructures of metals and alloys.
</li><li> To make students explore more about the metallic parts used in day to day life 
and in industry at large scale and to explore their microstructural features by 
thinking broader at “Micro”
level.</li></ol>-->
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tabcontent" id="structure-32">
			<h2>Event Structure :</h2>
			<p>
			<b>Task:</b><br>
			<ol>
			<li>
			Teams must build an autonomous robot which can trace line, decode the code and 
			make turning decisions as directed by the code and finally push the box in the space provided.</li>
			<li>
			There will be checkpoints placed at certain locations for 
			repositioning of the bot in case of hand touch.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<b>Note: </b>The event to push box by robot and making it to deposit in
			the gap by is termed as <b>destroying of opponent’s territory.</b> 
			The robot should not physically damage the wall and the box.
			<br><br>
			<b>Special features: </b> There will be a binary code painted on some parts of the track. 
			The code consists of 3 black/white squares placed in <b>a line perpendicular to the track.</b>
			The side of the square will be equal to the width of the track. 
			The code will decide whether the bot has to take a left or right on the upcoming cross shape track or ‘T’ shape track.
			The “intelligent” bot is expected to read the code as it moves over it and decode it, to find out the next direction to go.. 
			Correct decoding of the code and hence the correct path tracing will earn you points. 
			The actual code at the time of competition will be revealed only after the competition starts. (i. e. after dry run).
			<br><br>
			This code-decoding part is an <b>innovative part of the competition</b> designed for the challenge takers.
			Following the code will fetch you more points than simple line follower.
			So if you think you can make an “intelligent” line follower bot, you can design considering the code.
			<br><br>
			However, the team can go ahead with a normal line follower bot and still can take part in the competition.

 It cannot start in either direction. The operator may abort run at any time.</li>
 <li> The robot should not physically damage the path and the box.</li>
 <li> The team that scores maximum points wins.</li></ol>
 <br>
 <b>Hand Touch:</b><br>
 <ol>
 <li> If an operator touches the robot during run, this will be considered as a hand-touch and
 the robot must be put back at the last restart or checkpoint crossed.
 (Robot can be removed after completion of match, i.e. after placing the box.)</li>
 <li> The operator can take any number of hand touches with prior permission from judge. 
 There is NO penalty for a hand touch (with prior permission) 
 though the robot must be placed back at the start or last checkpoint crossed.</li>
 <li> Even if a participant takes a hand touch, the clock will keep running and 
 will not be reset as the robot starts again from the previous restart point.</li>
 <li> If a robot ‘gets into trouble’ the operator can ask the judge for permission to take a hand touch and restart the robot at start or last checkpoint.
 If the operator touches the robot without prior permission of the judge during run time, 10 points will be deducted.</li>
 </ol>
 <br>
 <b>General Rules:</b><br>
 <ol>
 <li> Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified 
 from the competition automatically. Programming of bot is not allowed once the competition starts.</li>
 <li> The machine will be checked for its safety before the match and will be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators.</li>

<li> In case of a match resulting in a tie, rematch of 2 minutes will be played. 
If further tie occurs team scoring highest points in first 3 minutes of the main match will be declared as a winner.</li></ol>
<br>
<b>Criteria for Victory:</b>
<ol>
<li> A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.</li>
<li> A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot show linear or rotational motion of at least one foot within a time of 30 seconds.
<ol><li> A robot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted immobilized, if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement.</li>
<li> In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.</li></ol></li>
<li> Points will be given based on aggression, damage, control and strategy, fall in the pit.</li></ol>
<br>
<b>Aggression:</b>
Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.
<br><br>
<b>Control:</b>
Control means a robot can attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its weapons in the most effective way, avoid Arena Hazards, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons.
<br><br>
<b>Damage:</b>
Through deliberate action, a robot either directly, or indirectly using the Arena Hazards, reduces the functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered relevant if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning device on a robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered "deliberate".
<br><br>
<b>Strategy:</b>
The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate defense plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent. Strategy can also involve using the Arena Hazards to gain an advantage.
<br><br>
<b>Disqualification:</b>
<ol>
<li> Robots intentionally damaging the wires of the opponent will be disqualified.</li>
<li> Robots intentionally and extensively damaging the arena will be disqualified.</li>
<li> If the wires of robot are cut because of its own strategy and if fail to repair within match time then the team will be disqualified.</li></ol>
<b>Note: There is no separate point allocation to the opposition in case if the bot is pushed or is stuck within the pit area.</b>
<br><b>Game Field:</b>
<ol>
<li> Outer part of the field is a hexagon of side 3810mm (300 in) in having inner hexagon of side 298 in in (actual game field).</li>
<li> There is starting zone of size 750 x 750mm.</li>
<li> Material used for game field will be made of plywood.</li>
<li> There will be a safety wall provided around the game field. Height of safety wall will be 1.5 meters and it will be made up of fence and acrylic.</li></ol>
<b>Depth of the pit will be around 60mm-80mm and the size of each pit is 3824 x 100 mm2</b>
<br><br><b>Bot Dimensions and Fabrications:</b>
<ol>
<li> The robot should fit in the box of 750 mm x 750 mm x 1000 mm (l x b x h) always.
<b>Note: The external device used to control the robot or any external tank is not included in the size constraint.</b></li>
<li> The robot should not exceed 40 kg of weight including the weight of pneumatic source/tank.
 If the tank is external, its weight would be considered 1.5 times its actual weight.</li>
<li> Weight of wireless robots and robots having on-board power supply will be counted as 0.6 times the actual weight of robot.</li>
<li> Weight of the remote controller and adapter will be considered.</li></ol>

<b>Motion of the Robot:</b>
<ol><li> Jumping and hopping is not allowed.</li>
<li> Flying (using air-foil, helium balloons, ornithopters etc.) is not allowed.</li></ol>

<b>Control of Robot:</b>
<ol><li> Robot can have a wired or wireless control.</li>
<li> Off board power supplies are allowed.</li>
<li> If the machine is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition.
 All the wires coming out of the machine should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated.
