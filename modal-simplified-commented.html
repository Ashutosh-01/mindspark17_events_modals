			<h2>Objectives :</h2>
			<p>
				Our country, inhabited by over 1.3 billion people, is amid a massive transition from rural characteristics to urban characteristics. India is urbanizing rapidly offering great opportunities to build a new nation, while facing challenges in sustainable urban growth. It is a huge task to manage increasing population pressure on existing urban areas and to provide good quality of life to the residents. This can be achieved by creating a Utopian Society that leverages technology, utilizes existing and planned infrastructure and promotes economic, social, environmental changes through our theme <b>‘Towards Techno-Utopia’.</b><br><br>

			City planning deals with the concept of “smart-city”- the ability of a city to develop at the highest level, the potential of the citizens and of its resources towards achieving a collective well-being i.e. quality of life. Districts are where people live and make decisions about key city systems, such as transport and energy consumption. The main challenge in this priority area is to reduce Environmental impact, and work in areas of Community planning (slums), Infrastructure (physical and social) and Transportation. This will require managing and integrating all the smart services and comprise a city’s ecosystem in areas such as the environment, energy, urban mobility, leisure and administration. Metropolis is a platform for young generation to give a future development plan for a given problem in an innovative manner considering the above factors. <br><br>
			The problem statement will be made available 20 days before the start of MindSpark’17. Participants are required to study the problem statement and find an innovative solution to the problem. They should prepare sheets (A1 size) and write a report which explains their idea and a 3D model (selected participants) which depicts their solution.

A.  No.  The  external  wireless  remote  control  used  to  control  the  machine  is  not 
included in the machine dimensions. <br><br>
Q. What will
the preliminary round be like? <br>
A. In the preliminary round, each team will be given a run of 2 individual laps and 
the best lap time will be considered.<br><br> 
Q. Do all the participants need to submit their abstract?<br> 
A. Yes, all participants need to send in
their abstracts. Also, you must send in close 
up  photos  of  your  empty  chassis,  steering  system  and  suspension  system.  The 
abstract enables the organizers to make sure that you are genuinely putting in effort 
to make the car; so, even if your car is not co
mplete do send the abstracts. It also 
helps us to make sure that ready
-
made cars are not entertained in the qualification 
round itself. <br><br>
Q. Which parts can be bought from the market?<br> 
A. Engine, clutch, differentials, and drive shafts (transmission system
), tires can be 
ready
-
made.  Braking  system,  gears,  servos,  shock  absorbers,  springs,  pulley, 
pulley belt and wheel hub can be used ready
-
made from market. <br><br>
Q. What parts have to be fabricated by the participants?<br> 
A.  Steering  system,  Suspension  system  and
Chassis  need  to  be  made  by  the 
participants themselves. Use of ready
-
made components is strictly prohibited. Any 
team  found  to  have  any  of  the  above  mentioned  parts  ready
-
made  will  be 
disqualified. <br><br></div>

<b>Round 1:</b>
Every boat has to complete 3 rounds in the arena. The RC boats with the 
best  lap  time  on  the  course  will  qualify  for  the  next  round.  The  number  of  teams 
that qualify for the next round will depend on the number of participating teams in 
the event.<br>
<b>Round 
2:</b>
The  qualified  RC  boats  will  then  face  balloon  obstacles  along  the 
course. Any boat that touches a balloon will be penalized by adding 14 seconds to 
their lap time. Similarly,  any boat touching the walls of arena will be penalized by 
adding  5  seconds  to
their  lap  time.  The  RC  boats  with  the  best  lap  time  on  the 
course  will  qualify  for  the  next  round.  The  number  of  teams  that  qualify  will 
depend on the number of participating teams in the event.<br>

This will be the final round with a minimum of 2 o
bstacles i.e balloons 
and plastic balls. Any boat that touches the balloon will be penalized by adding 14 
seconds  to  their  lap  time.  Similarly  any  boat  touching  the  walls  of  arena  will  be 
penalized by adding 5 seconds to their lap time. Now there’s a twist
,being  the fastest is not enough, points will be allotted for the circuit and design. The winner

<b>Aggression:</b>
Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.
<br><br>
<b>Control:</b>
Control means a robot can attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its weapons in the most effective way, avoid Arena Hazards, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons.
<br><br>
<b>Damage:</b>
Through deliberate action, a robot either directly, or indirectly using the Arena Hazards, reduces the functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered relevant if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning device on a robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered "deliberate".
<br><br>
<b>Strategy:</b>
The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate defense plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent. Strategy can also involve using the Arena Hazards to gain an advantage.

			<h2>Objectives :</h2>
			<p>
			Search N Destroy is basically a line following and maze solving competition.
			A track of white line on black background and/or black line on white background will be 
			laid out <b>with codes placed at some places</b> and an <b>autonomous robot</b> has to follow that line, 
			decode the path <b>based upon that code</b> and complete a task.<br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tabcontent" id="structure-32">
			<h2>Event Structure :</h2>
			<p>
			<b>Task:</b><br>
			<ol>
			<li>
			Teams must build an autonomous robot which can trace line, decode the code and 
			make turning decisions as directed by the code and finally push the box in the space provided.</li>
			<li>
			There will be checkpoints placed at certain locations for 
			repositioning of the bot in case of hand touch.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<b>Note: </b>The event to push box by robot and making it to deposit in
			the gap by is termed as <b>destroying of opponent’s territory.</b> 
			The robot should not physically damage the wall and the box.
			<br><br>
			<b>Special features: </b> There will be a binary code painted on some parts of the track. 
			The code consists of 3 black/white squares placed in <b>a line perpendicular to the track.</b>
			The side of the square will be equal to the width of the track. 
			The code will decide whether the bot has to take a left or right on the upcoming cross shape track or ‘T’ shape track.
			The “intelligent” bot is expected to read the code as it moves over it and decode it, to find out the next direction to go.. 
			Correct decoding of the code and hence the correct path tracing will earn you points. 
			The actual code at the time of competition will be revealed only after the competition starts. (i. e. after dry run).
			<br><br>
			This code-decoding part is an <b>innovative part of the competition</b> designed for the challenge takers.
			Following the code will fetch you more points than simple line follower.
			So if you think you can make an “intelligent” line follower bot, you can design considering the code.
			<br><br>
			However, the team can go ahead with a normal line follower bot and still can take part in the competition.
