			<p>
			On  the  Etch  is  an  event  which  provides  a  platform  for  the  students  who  are 
passionate  about  metallurgy  and  materials  science  to  present  their  metallographic 
skills.  Not  only  metallographic  skills  but  also  the
practical  thinking  and  logical 
reasoning ability of the participants will be tested in the competition.
The main objectives are as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>
To test the metallographic skills of students for sample preparation.
</li><li>
To test the logical reasoning ability o
f students by observation of 
microstructures of metals and alloys.
</li><li> To make students explore more about the metallic parts used in day to day life 
and in industry at large scale and to explore their microstructural features by 
thinking broader at “Micro”
level.</li></ol>

			<h2>Rules :</h2>
			<p>
			<ol><li>  Display  of  Microphotograph  (captured  on  Optical  microscope/SEM/TEM) 
during    presentation    is    mandatory.    Participants    failing    to    produce    the 
microphotograph may be disqualified.</li>
<li>
Fake micrographs will lead to the disqualification of the team.</li>
<li> The sample must strictly be prepared by the participants.</li>
<li> The sample selected for microstructural observation should be mounted by 
either hot or cold mounting method. Both, cross section (Radial in case of a cylindrical specimen) and longitudinal section of the same sample must be 
mounted together. Only longit
udinal section of the sample will be accepted
only
if 
the sample has very thin diameter i.e. less than 5 mm.</li>
<li>The  microphotograph  captured  on  either  Optical  Microscope  OR  Scanning 
Electron   Microscope(SEM)   OR   Transmission   Electron   microscope(TEM)   is 
expected to be presented with following mandatory specifications
<ol type="i">
<li>The magnification or scale must be burnt into the micrograph.</li>
<li>The size of the printed microphotograph must be 200mm*250 mm or A4 size.</li>
<li>he composition of the sample is to be pres
ented along with the micrograph. If 
participants are unable to know the composition of their specimen sampled from an 
unknown  component,  they  can  refer  the  available  research  papers  and  literature 
regarding the component. If still they are unable to solve 
the problem, they are free 
to contact the event heads</li>
<li>The typical features (advantages, disadvantages etc.) of the concerned 
microstructure.</li>
<li>Typical applications of the components having the concerned microstructure in 
industry.</li>
<li>A 1 or 2
-
page 
hand
-
out comprising of summary of the specimen preparation to 
introduce it to judges in least possible words.</li>
<li>The mount 
should comprise 
of the sample whose micrograph is captured</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Participants are expected to prepare a sample of any failed industri
al component 
or any other metallic spare part which is readily available and free of cost. The 
metal objects which 
are generally used by us in day
-
to
-
day life will also be 
accepted. Ferrous alloys will be preferred for sampling. This change has 
specificall
y been made in the competition to develop practical approach towards 
sampling of specimens.</li>
<li>To give more clarification regarding the points ‘5.iii’ and ‘5.iv’, 
<b>a small session 
will be conducted few days prior to the event</b>
which will help participants to
apply the theoretical concepts about different microstructures in revealing the 
microstructures of the components used in practice. Date, timings and more details 
about the session will be informed afterwards to the registered participants.</li>
<li>Micrographs
are not allowed to be captured on the day of the event.</li>
<li>Presentation of photographs on laptops is not allowed. Only printed micrographs 
are allowed to
be
present
ed
before the Judges.</li>
<li>Participants should carry their college ID cards as a proof for 
identity on the 
day of the event along with the receipt of registration.</li>
<li>Decision made by the judges and organizers will be final and binding 
to 
all the 
partic
ipant teams in case of any tie.</li>

<b>Round 1:</b> 
Qualification Round: <br>
This  round  will  consist  of  time  trials.  Two  laps
are  to  be  completed  one-by-one. 
The best lap time will be considered and relative ranking will be done accordingly. 
First 16 teams will be shortlisted for the next round.<br>
<b>Round 2:</b> 
Elimination Round:<br> 
Top 16 teams from first round will be selected for th
is round. 
A  modified track  shall be  disclosed  at  the  time  of  event  and  each  team  will  get  a 
copy of all the details of the other teams and all teams will be given 15 minutes to 
analyze the track. Each team beginning from rank 1 will get a chance to challe
nge 
any  team.  Any  team  can  reject  a  challenge  only  twice,  except  when  the  team  is 
being challenged by a team ranked lower than it. If the challenge thrown by a team 
is rejected, the next ranked team gets the chance to challenge any team. 
If  a  challenge is
accepted,  a time  slot  will  be  given  to  those teams  and  the  match 
will  be  conducted.  In  this  round,  after  the  challenge,  all  the  16  teams  race  with 
their respective competitors and the 8 winning teams will be promoted to the next round.<br>
<b>Round  3: </b>
Same  procedure  of  challenging  will  be  followed  after  modifying  the 
track in Round 3. At the end of the third round, the 4 winning teams will be ranked 
according to the time in which they complete the race. <br>
<b>Finals:</b> 
<ol>
<li> The  finals  consist  of  4  matches:  Semifinal  1
and  Semifinal  2,  followed  by  3rd 
place playoff and the Megafinal.</li>

A. Yes, all participants need to send in
their abstracts. Also, you must send in close 
up  photos  of  your  empty  chassis,  steering  system  and  suspension  system.  The 
abstract enables the organizers to make sure that you are genuinely putting in effort 
to make the car; so, even if your car is not co
mplete do send the abstracts. It also 
helps us to make sure that ready
-
made cars are not entertained in the qualification 
round itself. <br><br>
Q. Which parts can be bought from the market?<br> 
A. Engine, clutch, differentials, and drive shafts (transmission system

<b>Round 
2:</b>
The  qualified  RC  boats  will  then  face  balloon  obstacles  along  the 
course. Any boat that touches a balloon will be penalized by adding 14 seconds to 
their lap time. Similarly,  any boat touching the walls of arena will be penalized by 
adding  5  seconds  to
their  lap  time.  The  RC  boats  with  the  best  lap  time  on  the

			<h2>Objectives :</h2>
			<p>
Conservation  of  energy  and  mass  are  two  rules  which  govern  the  universe.  This 
event is designed towards converting energy from one form to another and driving 
a  series  of  events  which  will  ultimately  carry  out  the  given  task.  The  more 
complicated the contr
aption, higher the points earned.
