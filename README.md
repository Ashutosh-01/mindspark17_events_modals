# mindspark17_events_modals
Source code for mindspark17 event modals www.mind-spark.org

You need to add your modal in modal-simplified-commented.html or modal-simplified-commented-other.html

After all modals are done both files will be concatenated

If you find a typo anywhere.. feel free to correct it

To edit a file, click on edit button and make changes

To add your own modal here, just go to the end of body tag and add your modal there

DONOT copy script and css again at the end.. paste only the modal and also the trigger button

After all the changes are done.. click create pull request

Hope it is readable
